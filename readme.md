So, today(02/07/2024 - Tuesday). I will learn these:
1. Rust
2. Zig
3. Solidity
4. C
5. Cpp
6. Assembly

# Best VScode Extentions for Rust:
1. CodeLLDB (vadimcn.vscode-lldb)
2. crates (serayuzgur.crates)
3. Even Better TOML (tamasfe.even-better-toml)

Hey, bro. So, I am 100% sure that I can do this project.
I am an experienced fullstack software engineer who loves to learn new techs and make something useful from that. My skills list:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////|
1. Frontend(WWW): Nextjs (React senior + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn ui framework -> I am constantly trying to put my own component here + Firebase)                                                                                                                                |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
2. Backend: Django + Elysia -> it is like Express but better + Laravel + and I am in a ongoing hunt to learn all use full backend technologies...                                                                                                                             |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
3. Blockchain: Solidity + Rust + currently exploring the new stuffs in blockchain space. I already know web3.js, ethers.js, Viem -> just like ehters.js but better. And I can also handle the smart contracts part.                                                           |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
4. Ai: I personally don't like this Ai madness cause. For this my programming skills are at risk but I cannot deny the fact that it is more useful than the Blockchain madness that occurred some time earlier. So, I somehow managed myself to learn this new Ai techs and  | currently learning...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
5: Frontend(MOBILE): React Native + Flutter + Kotlin Android Studio + Swift iOS (I use windows 10, so you know there are OS related cons here)                                                                                                                                |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
6. Frontend(DESKTOP): Electron + Tauri + just the native windows development + I use windows so Linux and Mac is out of my reach now but I think I am capable to make an app for these OS also.                                                                               |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
7. (OUT OF TOPICS): UNREAL v5(No, as I am saying I use a pc which doesn't have any GPU. So I cannot do anything related to this but I will soon buy a fresh GPU for my PC. So then I can do this  task also)                                                                  |

So, now you already know about all of my skills. Here is the list of some of my already created projects: 
New Admin Panel: https://admin-panel-mahabub.vercel.app/
New Online Study Website: https://ustudy-mahabub.vercel.app/

Websites I have made before:
1. https://manofexistence.vercel.app/
2. https://manofexistence-professional-portfolio.vercel.app/
3. https://manofexistence-brainwave.vercel.app/
4. https://fiverr-rocket-krypt.vercel.app/
5. https://aladdin.vercel.app/
6. https://lolgamer-xstream.vercel.app/

So, Thank you. Yes,  (ðŸ‘Š)you my friend that you made it this far. I personally with my bare hands using the my bare bare... or just the keyboard... Keyboard made this proposal. Didn't used any chatGPT or any of those Ai's out there. So, I am hoping that you will find this proposal funny and If you think that your project needs someone like me then don't keep that thought in only at your mind and just message me in my account.
