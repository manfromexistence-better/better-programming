drizzle overview I cloned earlier today is now gone. I don't know how or why. Ohh, somehow I did't made it far enough in this repo. This is kinda weird but my first impression about drizzle is awesome and the drizzle overview repo is more awesome and easy.

### Useless bash script
```
#!/bin/bash

current_time=$(date +"%H:%M")
current_day=$(date +"%A")

current_date_time=$(date + "%r")
echo "Current date and time: $current_date_time"

echo "Hello Programmer, Good $(if [[ $(date +%H) -lt 12 ]]; then echo 'morning'; elif [[ $(date +%H) -lt 18 ]]; then echo 'afternoon'; else echo 'evening'; fi)."
echo "The current time is $current_time, and today is $current_day"

date +”%r”
```
