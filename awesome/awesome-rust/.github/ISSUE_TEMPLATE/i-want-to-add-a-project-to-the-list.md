If you open a "please add my project" issue, they will be ignored, and generally closed, as the overhead of writing them is notable and not something the maintainers have time to do. If you want to add a project, please open a PR adding it!

The _one_ exception to this is if you think there isn't a good location for the project (and you've checked the list at least twice already) and want to discuss options. If OTOH, we just haven't added the section, but there's an obvious name, please just open the PR adding it and we can talk there if needed.
