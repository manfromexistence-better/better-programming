<!--
Problems include
- There's a better way to do our linting
- We're doing something else wrong in the CI
- You have a suggestion for an auto-formatter for lines (not "we should do auto-formatting" as there's several issues about that already, but a concrete proposal)
- Something else that isn't "why isn't my project added?"
